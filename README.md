# binary_search_tree_algorithm

The intent of this project is to work with with information extracted from a 
municipal government data feed containing bids submitted for auction of property.
The data set is provided in two comma-separated files:

  *1. eBid_Monthly_Sales.csv (larger set of 17,937 bids)* <br>
  *2. eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv (smaller set of 179 bids)*

Implemented using C++, the project focuses on the use of a binary search tree data structure to 
search, update, and delete the associated data and uses timestamps compare and 
contrast algorithm efficiency for the various operations.
